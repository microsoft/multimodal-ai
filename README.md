## Overview

Welcome to the Multimodal AI project!

The goal of the Multimodal AI project is to provide an enterprise-ready solution for customers looking to infuse Generative AI (Gen AI) into their existing applications, or create brand-new applications, that go beyond processing text-based content only. This project leverages the latest advancements in multimodal AI, to implement generative AI solutions such as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), image classification or video analysis, for content based on text, images, audio and video. For images, the goal is to go beyond traditional Object Character Recognition (OCR) and generate embeddings on the actual image content

## About this project

This project has been created and is maintained by the Strategic Workload Acceleration Team (SWAT) at Microsoft and we aim to provide enterprise-ready GenAI solutions regardless of whether the data is in text, image, audio or video format.

With the rapid development and introduction of new multimodal AI models, such as [GPT-4o](https://openai.com/index/hello-gpt-4o/), customers are realizing the value of implementing GenAI solutions that go beyond simply using text-based documents within their organizations and instead, they are looking for solutions that leverage other media types that are in use within their organizations, for example, categorize a video and find specific scenes or analyse documents with images embedded that include architectural diagrams or flow charts to provide better answers to technical support personnel.

This project aims to provide a GenAI solution that enables customers to interact with their data across various formatsâ€”including text, text with images, images, audio, and video using native Azure PaaS services. Through this solution, data can be processed server-side on Azure for activities like chunking, generating images from files, creating embeddings, indexing content, extracting transcripts from videos, and identifying key scenes in videos, among other multimodal AI tasks. This architecture ensures an enterprise-grade, highly scalable solution that can grow with business demands by leveraging Azure's power and scalability, without reliance on client-side processing or local developer workstations.

## What's included
In this initial release, the Multimodal AI project includes:

- A RAG solution using Azure AI Services that allow users to interact with data contained in text and images (for example, charts or diagrams).
- A web client (see [references](#references)) that users can interact with to submit prompts, get results and visualize the citations.
   - Authentication via Entra Id can be configured during the initial deployment or afterwards.
- Reference implementations in Terraform and Bicep.
- A simple deployment experience, with a minimal set of prerequistes, that can easily be incorporated into CI/CD deployment pipelines.
- Data processing activities (like chunking, generating embeddings, converting documents to images, etc.) are executed server-side on Azure via Azure AI Search (using built-in capabilities as well as using custom skills).
- Usage of AI Search [data sources](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/AZURE/search/search-data-sources-gallery) for easier processing and ingestion of documents by simply uploading the documents, images, videos, etc. to Azure Storage (blob).
   - In this release only PDF file types are supported.
- Multimodal embeddings generated by using [AI Search integrated vectorization](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/vector-search-integrated-vectorization):
   - Images: Azure AI Vision multimodal embeddings skill (in preview): https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/cognitive-search-skill-vision-vectorize
   - Text: Azure OpenAI Embedding skill : https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/cognitive-search-skill-azure-openai-embedding
- Image generation from PDF files as part of the AI Search indexing process by using an Indexer.
- Usage of Azure AI Search [custom skills](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/cognitive-search-custom-skill-interface) (for activities like interacting with Azure Document Intelligence).
- Leverage AI Search [knowledge storage](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/knowledge-store-concept-intro) to persist images generated as part of the indexing process.

Please note that additional capabilities, including support for audio and video content, compatibility with other file types, the enablement of network security features like virtual networks and private endpoints, and deployment options via CI/CD pipelines are on the roadmap and will be incorporated in future releases.
